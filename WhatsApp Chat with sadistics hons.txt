I'm excited to share my recent project: A WhatsApp Chat Analyzer that I've developed using Python and Data Science techniques we learned in our program! 

🔍 The analyzer provides detailed insights including:
• Message frequency patterns
• User participation analysis
• Sentiment trends
• Timeline visualizations
• Word frequency analysis
• Media sharing patterns

🌐 Try it here: https://what-app-chat-analysis-acjm6z7wuapcdvfhgxjvov.streamlit.app/

📱 How to use it:
1. Open any WhatsApp chat (group or individual)
2. Click ⋮ (three dots) → More → Export chat
3. Choose 'Without Media'
4. Upload the exported file to the analyzer
5. Get instant insights!

The tool works perfectly for both group chats and individual conversations. You can analyze our department group chat too! 😊

Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. Feel free to share it with others who might find it useful!

Best regards,
[Mohit Kumar]
